“It is an illusion that photos are made with the camera… they are made with the eye, heart, and head.”
{: .notice--primary}



When I moved to the UK to pursue my PhD at York, I was excited to get my first camera to
document the novel enviroment around me.

I began with an APS-C DSLR from Nikon, which served me well as a starting point until I started exploring street photography. However, its slow focus speed was an issue on the streets. In 2023, I upgraded to a 35 mm (full-frame) mirrorless from Canon, which is my main camera now. Being full frame, it also allows more light onto the sensor, improving image quality in low-light situations.

I discovered enjoyment in photography from a desire to "capture" time and reflecting on it later. Initially, I found myself taking photos primarily when visiting new places or during trips. As I also enjoy walking outdoors, street photography became a natural way for me to continue capturing these frozen moments in time and experimenting with light as I stroll.

**Henri Cartier-Bresson**  
“For me the camera is a sketch book, an instrument of intuition and spontaneity, the master of the instant which, in visual terms, questions and decides simultaneously. In order to "give a meaning" to the world, one has to feel oneself involved in what one frames through the viewfinder. This attitude requires concentration, a discipline of the mind, sensitivity, and a sense of geometry.”
